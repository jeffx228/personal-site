I'm currently studying Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard. I'm also involved in Harvard Undergraduate Consulting for Business and the Environment (CBE) and Harvard Undergraduate Data Analytics (HDAG). My interests include NLP, ML/AI, full-stack web development, blockchain, and data science. I'm particularly interested in software engineering and quant, so if you have any related opportunities, feel free to get in touch with me!\n\n# Currently\n\nI'm spending the summer at home in the Bay Area, California. I'm currently working full-time at ThinkCERCA, a Chicago-based educational technology start-up, where I'm processing student essays to help teachers better evaluate paper quality using NLP and ML models. I'm also working part-time at AxonBytes, where I'm researching how to use Blockchain to create a new cryptocurrency! Finally, I am going to be a part-time instructor with Inspirit AI this summer to teach high schoolers basic machine learning concepts and libraries!\n\n# What I Did at Each Age\n\n- At age 0, I was born in Niskayuna, NY. From what my family has told me, I was whisked away to Beijing to live with my grandparents while my parents were busy with school and work.\n\n- At age 1, I was reunited with my parents. Legend has it that I barfed on my dad soon after taking flight in his arms.\n\n- At age 2, I was told that I was going to have a little brother. I didn't really like the idea of sharing my parents attention, but I was also excited to have another friend in the house.\n\n- At age 3, my brother Adam Xu was born. I still remember my grandma threatening to cut off my hand when I hit Adam. Big mistake, I'm honestly still scared to this day.\n\n- At age 4, I started preschool. \n\n- At age 5, I started kindergarten. Living in upstate New York, I was the only Asian kid in my entire elementary school.\n\n- At age 6, I discovered video games (Nintendo Game Cube). I was hooked on Mario Kart at my after school day care, Pals.\n\n- At age 7, my family moved to San Diego, CA. I was sad.\n\n- At age 8, my family moved again within San Diego. I switched schools twice within a single year.\n\n- At age 9, I started doing math contests. Ever heard of Math Kangaroo? Maybe not, but everyone has to start somewhere.\n\n- At age 10, I reached a double digit age. I remember reading a lot of Captain Underpants. Also Diary of a Wimpy Kid.\n\n- At age 11, I moved again. This time, to Northern California, to a city called Sunnyvale. \n\n- At age 12, I moved again. This time, to Saratoga, CA, where I would live until college. Sixth grade was not a bad time to have my final move, though. People were still meeting each other for the first year of middle school. I joined the middle school math club and took my first ever AMC 8. \n\n- At age 13, I started getting more into contest math. I took classes outside of school and read books on subjects not taught as much in school like Combinatorics and Number Theory. \n\n- At age 14, I finally qualified for the AIME on my third attempt. I also made it to Mathcounts State, which felt like a big deal at the time. I also started programming in Java at a summer class. \n\n- At age 15, I attended COSMOS, where I started learning more about chemistry and nanotechnology in a college setting. I pre-learned all of general chemistry towards the end of my freshman year to prepare, which definitely helped out in the future.\n\n- At age 16, I qualified for the USAJMO. I also attended the Secondary Student Training Program (SSTP) at the University of Iowa, where I conducted a six week research project on optimizing electron-beam lithography for nanofabrication applications. When I got back, I started researching how to build an SEM at Stanford. I started branching out from STEM and doing other activities at school too. Aside from Science Club, Math Club, and Science Bowl, I joined the school newspaper and organized the school's annual Benefit Fashion Show. I made a lot of new friends and met a lot of upperclassmen through these experiences.\n\n- At age 17, I earned a silver medal on the USAPhO (Physics) and honors on the USNCO (Chem). I was actually pretty confused as to what I wanted to pursue in college at this point. Everything seemed so interesting and fun, and I didn't want to choose.At this point, I'd also become the Head Commissioner of the Benefit Fashion Show and Editor-in-Chief of the school newspaper. So figuring out what I enjoyed most was even more so a challenge. \n\n- At age 18, I graduated high school and started my first semester at Harvard. I met lots of super cool people, and I'm still meeting more. From the classes I took, I feel like I'm leaning more towards concentrating in CS and Statistics. I think a big part of me is still trying to figure it out though.\n\n- I turned 19 this year. Stay tuned.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Biking\n- Skiing\n- Poker\n- Spicy foods, particularly Sichuan cuisine\n- Guitar (just started this summer)\n- Chatting with friends\n- Teaching kids\n- Hiking\n- The Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am originally from Clifton Park, New York. I have since lived in San Diego, Sunnyvale, Saratoga, and Cambridge.\n- I've been to Canada (uncle), Mexico, England, Germany, Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, and China.\n- In 2020, I planned on going to Taiwan for a senior trip with me and my high school friends. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, this never happened.\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I made this website after seeing how slick my HDAG Case Team Leader's was. It uses the same template from Michael D'Angelo. My CTL's name is Richard Zhu, look him up.\n- I lived in a 17 person \"hype\" house this past spring semester when Harvard didn't invite us on campus. We went by a few different names: Trap House, Crimson Hype House, A Friendly Inn, AFI, and Stair-bnb. It was quite iconic.\n- I've beaten all the Pokemon games from Diamond through Omega Ruby. I used R4i cheats on most of them, though.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- becoming a better version of myself.\n- being more healthy.\n- getting more sleep.\n- reading more.\n\n",l=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(o.b,Object(i.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(h.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Jeffrey Xu",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(s.a,{source:d,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
